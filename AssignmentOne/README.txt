Combine and clean the data from the three sources.

NOTE:
In 'Source_2' and 'Source_3', the 'variable' and 'source' columns should be combined to make one column.
For example, if the element in the 'variable' column is 5 for a certain timestamp, the 'source' is C, and the 'value' is 65.5, 
then the value of 65.5 should be in a column named something like 'C5' for that timestamp.
