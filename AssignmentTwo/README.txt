The columns in this dataset could be correlated to one another. The variable in the column named 'important' is used to monitor 
the process, and it could be used to control different certain aspects of the process. The ideal value for this column is 238. Anything under 
or over 238 means that one is underperforming.

Having an idea of which columns influence the 'important' column is useful, as this may give one an idea of changes that can be made to the system
to get the ideal value of 238. Furthermore, if one could predict what the 'important' value would be a few hours ahead, one could preemptively make
the necessary changes to the system to minimise underperformance.
